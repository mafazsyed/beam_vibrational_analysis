# Vibrational Analysis of a Steel Beam
This repository contains the data and corresponding report pretraining to the labs conducted for the vibrational analysis of a steel beam system.

## Key tasks included:

- Performed free and forced vibration tests on a steel beam system with and without damping, using a viscous dashpot damper.
- Utilized LabVIEWâ„¢ software for data acquisition and analyzed accelerometer readings to calculate natural frequencies, damping ratios, and resonance behavior.
- Applied theoretical models, including logarithmic decrement and half-power methods, to quantify damping and compare experimental results with theoretical predictions.
- Gained proficiency in interpreting frequency response curves and evaluating system parameters under varying damping conditions.
